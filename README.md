# Ticketify

A proof-of-concept, built to explore how streaming analytics could make ticket distribution more fair, transparent, and fan-first. working with spotify only at the moment.
Traditional ticket sales allow bots and scalpers to buy in bulk, creating artificial scarcity and inflated resale prices. Ticketify attempts to solve this

### What works for now
- Fetches Top Artists & Tracks
- Stores user profiles and ranking data
- Fan Priority Score calculation (prototype)
- Spotify-themed UI
